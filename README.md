Build from scratch a simple web application for uploading and displaying a list of products from a tab delimited file. 



Instructions
-------------

- Select the technologies that you feel the most comfortable with.

- Allocate between 2-4 hours for this assignment.

- Your project code should be completed in the [main](./main) folder.

- Go to issue #1. This is the Base of this project and is mandatory to complete. 

- In addition to #1, complete up to 3 additional items as time permits. Submit pull requests for each. 


Hints
-------------

- Add notes, observations or instructions to run your code to [Candidate_Notes.txt](./Candidate_Notes.txt).

- You will notice that each issue has labels for the level of difficulty and targets frontend or backend implementation. This should help you choose the tasks that are a good fit for your skills.

- The issues provide a high degree of freedom, and the implementation can be simple or complex. It is up to you to decide where to put more or less effort. This is a very simplistic project, but even on a project this small you can identify real life scenarios.



Deadline
-------------
Only the commits submitted in 48h since the test was shared with you will be considered.
